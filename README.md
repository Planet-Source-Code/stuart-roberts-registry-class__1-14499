## Registry Class


</div>

### Description

Gives you access to the entire Registry, allowing you to create\delete\modify keys and values. Give your programs a more professional look than if you used the default VB Registry calls GetSetting and SaveSetting.

I have written a program that uses the Registry class to output all the code neccessary to link your program to the Registry and could save hours or days of typing repetitive code, like I did! Drop me an email if you'd like to have a look at it.
